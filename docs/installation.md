# Installation

## Install or update Python
Before installing pydi-client, install Python 3.11.2 or higher.  

For information about how to get the latest version of Python, see the [official Python documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/).

## Setup a virtual environment
Once supported Python is installed, create a virtual environment and activate it

```bash
python -m venv /path
...
source /path/bin/activate

```
This will provide an isolated space for all installed python packages.

## Install with pip:

```bash
pip install pydi-client
```

For specific versions of pydi-client
```bash
pip install pydi-client==1.0.0

pip install pydi-client>=1.0.0
